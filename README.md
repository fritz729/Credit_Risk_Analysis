# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

This project involved the use of supervised machine learning to develop a model that can predict the credit risk of loans based on criteria categorizing each application.  The goal is to look at the strength and weaknesses of several modeling methods using various sampling methods and ensemble modeling to determine if any will be able to improve the ability to predict the risk associated with each loan.
